  isCompleted: boolean;
}
```

### 1.4 Admin Dashboard UI
- Admin layout with sidebar navigation
- Dashboard overview with stats cards
- Chapter management interface (list, add, edit forms)
- Episode management interface (list, add, edit, upload placeholder)
- Preview functionality

### 1.5 Mock Data & Polish
- Create realistic mock course data
- Add loading states and skeletons
- Implement smooth transitions
- Add micro-interactions and hover effects
- Mobile responsiveness testing

## Phase 2: Authentication & User Management
- Appwrite setup and configuration
- User registration and login flows
- Admin authentication and role protection
- Session management

## Phase 3: Backend Integration
- Appwrite database collections setup
- API routes for CRUD operations
- Real data replacing mock data
- User progress persistence

## Phase 4: Video Storage & Delivery
- Cloudflare R2 bucket setup
- Video upload functionality for admin
- Video streaming integration
- Thumbnail generation

## Phase 5: Production Readiness
- Performance optimization
- SEO implementation
- Analytics integration
- Payment integration (if needed)
- Deployment and monitoring

# Logical Dependency Chain

## Foundation First (Must be built first)
1. **Design system and theme setup** - All components depend on consistent styling
2. **Base layout components** - Header, footer, navigation structure
3. **Type definitions** - Data models for TypeScript consistency

## Getting to Visible Frontend Quickly
4. **Landing page** - First impression for investors, standalone component
5. **Course overview page** - Shows course structure at a glance
6. **Chapter page with episodes** - Core navigation pattern
7. **Video player page** - The main product experience

## Admin Interface (Can parallel with student UI)
8. **Admin layout and navigation** - Foundation for admin features
9. **Chapter management UI** - CRUD interface for chapters
10. **Episode management UI** - CRUD interface with upload placeholder

## Polish and Demo Ready
11. **Mock data population** - Realistic content for demo
12. **Animations and transitions** - Premium feel
13. **Responsive design pass** - Mobile-ready
14. **Loading states and skeletons** - Professional polish

## Backend Integration (After UI Demo)
15. **Appwrite setup** - Auth and database
16. **API routes** - Connect frontend to backend
17. **Real data migration** - Replace mock with real
18. **Video storage setup** - R2 integration

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
- **Video playback performance:** Start with embedded player (YouTube/Vimeo placeholder), implement custom player in Phase 4
- **Large file uploads:** Defer to Phase 4, use placeholder UI now
- **Authentication complexity:** Use Appwrite's built-in auth to simplify

## MVP Definition
The MVP for investor demo is:
- Stunning landing page
- Functional course browsing UI
- Video player page (can use placeholder videos)
- Admin dashboard UI (forms don't need to save yet)
- All with mock data but fully interactive navigation

## Resource Constraints
- Single developer focus: Prioritize visible features over backend
- Time pressure: Use shadcn/ui components to accelerate development
- Content: Use placeholder videos/thumbnails until real content available

# Appendix

## Design References
- Premium dark theme aesthetic (think Bloomberg Terminal meets modern streaming)
- Color palette: Deep blacks (#0a0a0a), rich grays, gold/amber accents (#d4af37, #f59e0b)
- Typography: Modern sans-serif, clear hierarchy
